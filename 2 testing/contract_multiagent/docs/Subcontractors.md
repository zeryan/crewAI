Contractor shall be entitled to perform part, but not all, of its undertakings pursuant to this Contract, through Subcontractors, provided that neither the act of subcontracting nor any approval of the Subcontractors by the Owner shall release the Contractor or in any way derogate or diminish, restrict, or reduce from any obligation or liability of the Contractor towards the Owner arising from or under this Contract. Contractor shall be solely liable for all acts, omissions, liabilities, and performance of the Works (including Defects therein) of its Subcontractors. For the avoidance of doubt, even with Owner’s written approval, Contractor shall at all times be liable for its obligations hereunder and shall be held liable to Owner for any actions or omissions of the Subcontractor or Subcontractor’s Personnel. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Contract, Contractor shall be solely responsible for engaging, managing, supervising, and paying all Subcontractors and persons directly or indirectly employed by them. Contractor shall require that all Works performed, and all Equipment provided by Subcontractors be received, inspected, and otherwise furnished in accordance with this Contract.
The Contractor and the Subcontractors shall not be entitled to subcontract the supply of Equipment, Materials or services to more than two (2) tiers of subcontractors below the Contractor, unless otherwise approved in writing by Owner For each of the Major Services, Contractor will be restricted to directly contracting one (1) Subcontractor (such Subcontractor being permitted to enter into further subcontracts in accordance with the additional requirements set out in this Section 3.20), unless the Owner provides, in its sole discretion, its express written consent to the subcontracting of additional Subcontractors for such Major Subcontractors.

 all matters relating to the Subcontractors and their performance of the Works on behalf of the Contractor. The Subcontract Manager shall be a Key Staff Position.
(b) The Subcontract manager shall be responsible for, inter alia:
(1) the supervision, inspection and oversight of the Works to be performed by
the Subcontractors on behalf of the Contractor

(3) Contractor’s compliance with its obligations in accordance with, arising out or in connection with this Contract that relate to the subcontracting of the Works (with particular reference to this Section 3.20).
Acceptable Subcontractors
(a) Annex 11 [Subcontracting] contains a list of Subcontractors (deemed as acceptable Subcontractors) acceptable to Owner who may provide major equipment or major services for the Facility or services in connection with the Works. Contractor will be obligated, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Owner as set forth in this Section 3.20, to select from Annex 11 [Subcontracting] those Subcontractors who will be providing the equipment and/or services set forth therein.
(b) Owner and Contractor will have the right to recommend additions or deletions to Annex 11 [Subcontracting], though any addition or deletion will be subject to mutual agreement in writing between the Parties through a modification of this Contract. Contractor may award Subcontracts to any Subcontractor listed in Annex 11 [Subcontracting] for such equipment or service at Contractor’s sole discretion. In addition, Contractor must seek and obtain Owner’s approval prior in accordance with the remaining provisions of this Section to retain or hire any Subcontractor not included in Annex 11 [Subcontracting] if such Subcontractor is a Major Subcontractor.
(c) Any addition or removal by Contractor, or successor or replacement, of any Major Subcontractor in Annex 11 [Subcontracting] will be subject to Owner’s prior written approval. Should Contractor wish to modify the list of Major Subcontractors listed on Annex 11 [Subcontracting], Contractor shall make such request to Owner in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which Contractor wishes such modification to the list of Major Contractors to be effective. In addition, should Contractor wish to enter into a Subcontract for any major equipment or major services with a subcontractor not listed on Annex 11 [Subcontracting], it shall make such request to Owner in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which Contractor wishes to enter into such subcontract. For the avoidance of doubt, Owner may, in its sole discretion, either consent to or reject any request by Contractor made in accordance with this Section 3.20.1(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for potential subcontractors that Owner wishes to contract to the Key Services relating to commissioning, to the extent that the proposed subcontractor is not included Annex 11 [Subcontracting], Contractor shall make the requests set forth in this Section 3.20.1(c) at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which Contractor wishes to Contract such potential

Owner shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide its response to Contractor’s request promptly, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after receiving such request.
(d) Contractor will provide to Owner such company descriptive information concerning all Major Subcontractors associated with the Works as Owner may reasonably request. If at any time during the performance of the Works any Subcontractor performing Work at the Site becomes unacceptable to Owner due to such Subcontractor’s repeated failure or refusal to perform such Works in a safe manner in material compliance with the requirements of the HSE Plan and any and all safety and security plans and manuals applicable to the performance of the Works or the Plant, or in compliance with Applicable Laws or Applicable Permits, or because of such Subcontractor is affected by an Insolvency Event; or a lien is placed over its assets, in a manner which may adversely affect the Subcontractors ability to fulfill any of its obligations under the relevant Subcontract, or because of its delay in achieving the part of the Works subcontracted to it (so that such delay might potentially cause a delay in achieving a Critical Milestone by the Guaranteed Date for such Critical Milestone), then, upon written notice from Owner, such Subcontractor shall be removed from Annex 11 [Subcontracting] and Contractor shall procure of the termination of that Subcontractor’s involvement in the Project, if applicable, and Contractor will replace such unacceptable Subcontractor with another Subcontractor (i) set forth in Annex 11 [Subcontracting] or (ii) approved by Owner, if required, in accordance with this Section 3.20.1.
(e) Contractor will be responsible for all costs associated with the removal and replacement of any such unacceptable Subcontractor, replaced due to the above circumstances.
