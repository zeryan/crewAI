General Scope of Contract
Scope of Work
(a) The Contractor hereby assumes overall liability, obligation and responsibility to execute, perform and complete the Works and deliver the PV Plant to the Owner, the PV Plant being fully functional, complete, connected to the Grid, fully tested and complying with all requirements to achieve Substantial Completion (and Final Completion after the Warranty Period expires), excluding the Excluded Works, compliant with this Contract, all without the need for any further work of any kind or nature, all for a lump sum and on a fixed price, certain date, full “turnkey” basis. It is understood, as an essential consideration for Owner entering into this Contract, that the Facility shall be designed, procured and constructed so as to effectively achieve, at minimum, the Minimum Performance Guarantees on a continuous basis during the Warranty Period for Production.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt and without derogating from the general purport of the preceding paragraph, the scope of the Contractor's responsibilities, obligations and undertakings under this Contract shall also include the correction of Defects in accordance with or arising out of Contractor’s obligations in this Contract, and the provision of the warranties and guarantees set out in this Contract.
(c) The Contractor shall, subject to this Contract, be solely responsible, and shall bear all liabilities with respect to the Site, the Works, and the PV Plant from the NTP Date (or LNTP Date, if applicable) and until Substantial Completion, excluding the obligations explicitly assumed by the Owner hereunder.
(d) The Contractor has reviewed the Existing Documents, is acquainted with the terms and provisions thereof and, subject to specific limitations set forth as agreed in this Contract, the Contractor assumes those risks and liabilities relevant to the Works under said documents and any Applicable Permits obtained following the date hereof. The Contractor undertakes to perform its obligations under the Contract in such a manner as not to cause a breach of the Owner of its obligations under the aforesaid documents and all Legal Requirements and shall refrain for any act or omission which may cause the Owner to be in violation thereof.
(e) The Owner does not represent or warrant that the information in the Existing Documents is either complete or accurate. It is expressly understood that no information derived from an investigation, or interpretation of the Existing Documents by the Contractor or any representatives of the Contractor, will, in any way, relieve the Contractor from any responsibility, risk or obligation to properly fulfill its obligations under this Contract. The Contractor relies on the Existing Documents and any other information provided by the Owner, at Contractor’s own risk. It is the Contractor’s
Page 39 of 178
  
 responsibility to verify such information and ascertain whether there were any errors or inaccuracies in such documents and information.
(f) Owner requirements, supervision, inspection, review, approval, information, visitation, or similar rights granted to the Owner, the Owner's Representative, the Works Director or any other person acting on Owner's behalf, the Owner, the Financing Entities or the Technical Advisor or other persons acting on their behalf are merely to verify the fulfillment of the Contractor's obligations set forth herein. No knowledge, inspection, examination, verification, testing, proposal, comment, requirement, rejection, approval or consent, on the part of any of the foregoing, with respect to any matter herein, shall impose upon them any liability or responsibility whatsoever towards the Contractor or any Contractor’s personnel nor shall it, in any manner, derogate or discharge the Contractor from any of the Contractor's liabilities, obligations or responsibility under this Contract, unless explicitly specified otherwise in this Contract.
(g) The obligations and undertakings set forth in the O&M Contract shall not derogate in any manner from any of the Contractor's obligations, undertakings, duties, responsibilities, or liabilities under this Contract. No act or omission on the part of the O&M Contractor shall relinquish, absolve, derogate, or discharge the Contractor from any of the Contractor's liabilities, duties, obligations, responsibilities or representation or warranties under this Contract, nor serve as cause or grounds for any claim or demand against the Owner.
(h) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that the intent of this Contract is to prescribe the general requirements and details for the turnkey design, engineering, procurement, permitting, fabrication, construction, installation and completion of the Works which Contractor undertakes to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Contract, complying with Good Industry Standards (or, where applicable, the more stringent standard specified in this Contract), and within the time frames set forth in this Contract. It is the intent of this Contract that Contractor shall perform or cause to be performed all work and services and provide all materials, equipment, machinery, tools, labor, utilities, chemicals, transportation, administration and incidentals as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the functions and requirements indicated in this Contract applicable to the Works and to provide Owner with a completed PV Plant, capable of operating as specified in this Contract, on a turnkey basis, that will meet the performance criteria and other conditions of this Contract, whether or not the individual activities or details of such work, services, materials, equipment, machinery, tools, labors, utilities, chemicals, transportation, administration and incidentals necessary for the performance of the Works are specifically mentioned or indicated in this Contract.
(i) Details of the Works include but are not limited to (a) the design, engineering, procurement, construction, assembly, installation, start-up and testing, and completion of the Project, (b) the provision, management and supervision of all labour, transportation, administration and other services as required in connection with any of the foregoing, and (c) the inspection and furnishing of all materials, equipment, machinery, tools, temporary structures, temporary utilities as required in connection with the foregoing including the performance obligations described in this Section or otherwise required by in accordance with, arising out of or in connection with the
Page 40 of 178

 performance of Contractor’s obligations as set forth by this Contract, For the avoidance of doubt, elements that are not specifically mentioned or indicated in this Contract, shall be considered as being part of the Works and performed by Contractor at its expense so long as such details: (i) are within the general definition of the described scope of Works; (ii) should be reasonably inferable from the requirements of this Contract to be a typical part thereof or reasonably incidental thereto; or (iii) are necessary to complete the safe and proper performance of the Works according to the requirements of this Contract and do not entitle Contractor to a Change hereunder. The Technical Specifications are Owner’s criteria for efficiency, reliability, operability, maintainability, quality of equipment, and performance of equipment and systems. Where the Technical Specifications are different from the Applicable Laws in effect as of the Effective Date, the more stringent shall apply, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph. Where this Contract describes portions of the Works in general terms, but not in complete detail, it is understood that, subject to Contractor meeting the requirements of this Contract and the Technical Specifications, Good Industry Standards are to prevail and that only new materials and workmanship according to the requirements of the Warranty are to be used. The Price is based upon compliance with Applicable Laws and Applicable Permits as they are in effect on the Effective Date. Unless such change of Applicable Laws or Applicable Permits constitutes a Change of Law (in which case the provisions of Section 5.7.2 shall apply), in the event any Government Authority with jurisdiction over the PV Facility, the Parties or any element of the Works, requires, within the limits of their responsible authority, changes in the design or construction of the PV Facility or any element of the Works as a requirement for or condition to any Applicable Permit, such changes shall not result in any change in the Price or in an extension of time for the completion of the Works.
Due Performance:
(a) The Contractor shall perform the Works continuously, professionally, timely, efficiently and in workmanlike manner through suitably qualified, skilled, and certified (where applicable) professional personnel, and in accordance with: (i) prudent and acceptable design, engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning practices normally employed in similar projects; and (ii) the provisions of this Contract.
(b) The Contractor undertakes that all Works (including the remedy of Defects) shall be performed, and the PV Plant will be completely finished, tested, connected to the Grid and Commercially Operational:
(1) in compliance with the Contract including the Detailed Design, Technical Specifications, the Project Schedule, the HSE Plan and, where applicable, Manufacturer Requirements;
(2) in a manner fit for its intended use and purpose.
Compliance with Legal Requirements:
(a) The Contractor represents that it is thoroughly familiarized and satisfied with the Legal Requirements. Contractor further assures that it shall comply at all times, with the
Page 41 of 178
   
 Legal Requirements, and shall perform the Works and be responsible that the PV Plant is designed and constructed in a timely manner to be in full compliance with all Legal Requirements.
(b) Any breach of Contractor to comply with the Legal Requirements will allow the Owner to collect, as penalty (“clausula penal”), the amount set forth in Annex 16 [Liquidated Damages and Fines]. This amount applies for each Contractor’s breach and is in addition to and not in lieu of any other right of the Owner under the Contract. It is expressly agreed that Owner may collect this amount established as penalty and, either simultaneously or by separate action, also require the Contractor: (i) to take all necessary measures (and remedial actions) to fulfill the Legal Requirements; and/or (ii) collect damages related to Contractor ́s breach to the Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, said penalty shall not be included in the computation of the aggregate liability of the Contractor for liquidated damages for the purposes of Section 10.3 or Section ¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia. hereof.
In case of a change in the Legal Requirements, Contractor will still be bound for all purposes under this Contract to comply with any so changed Legal Requirements and, where such changes constitute a Change of Law, Contractor shall use best efforts to reduce and mitigate the delays the circumstances underlying such a Change of Laws might entail for the Owner and shall also use its best efforts to mitigate the costs underlying such change.
Environmental and Permit Compliance:
(a) The Contractor shall, in the performance of its obligations as set forth in, in connection with and arising out of the Contract, and be responsible that the PV Plant shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Good Industry Standards, to be in full compliance with the Environmental Guidelines, Applicable Permits, and any and all environmental laws, regulations and rules applicable to the Project, including, but not limited to the RCA.
(b) Without derogating from the general purport of the foregoing, the Contractor shall take all measures to protect the environment required under Applicable Law, and to avoid any damage, injury, or nuisance to third party or property, resulting from dust emission, pollution, Hazardous Materials or any other consequence of the performance of the Works. The Contractor shall provide for proper sorting and removal, destruction or recycling of the waste, debris and/or broken equipment, all as required by any applicable Legal Requirement and, at the Owner’s request, shall provide the Owner confirmation thereof.
(c) The Contractor shall immediately notify the Works Director in writing of any inspection performed by an environmental official at the Site and any reports or fines resulting therefrom.
(d) Contractor shall act and cooperate with Owner for all purposes related to the RCA and all of Owner’s other obligations in connection with Owner’s compliance with the Environmental Guidelines, Applicable Permits, and any and all environmental laws, regulations, and rules applicable to the Owner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Contractor shall provide and shall diligently prepare and deliver to the
Page 42 of 178
     
 Owner all documentation and information that is reasonably necessary for Owner to comply with its obligations (including reporting obligations) under the RCA which relate to the Works. If any Contractor Permit (or application for a Contractor Permit) is in the name of Owner, and the Contractor requires that the Owner must perform an action with respect to such permit or application (including if Owner must sign documentation with respect to such permit or application), Contractor shall request that Owner perform the relevant action with least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which the Contractor requires that such action is performed. For the avoidance of doubt, Owner’s undertaking of such actions in accordance with the foregoing (or signature on any such documents) does not imply Owner’s approval of the same shall not be construed as an act of acceptance by Owner, nor shall it impose any liability upon the Owner or relieve the Contractor from any liability, obligation, or responsibility under this Contract or under any Applicable Law. All documentation and information required to be prepared by Contractor in accordance with this Section 3.4 shall be prepared by Contractor, in a manner with respect to such timing, detail, form and substance, required in order to comply with Applicable Laws or Applicable Permits (including the RCA) or with the requests of any Governmental Authority in connection thereto.
(e) For the avoidance of doubt and without derogating from Contractor’s indemnity obligations as set forth in this Contract, the Contractor shall, in accordance with Section 13.3 indemnify, defend and hold Owner harmless in relation to any claim, cost, losses or expenses howsoever arising incurred by Owner in connection with any damage, pollution, environmental degradation or nuisance resulting from any breach by Contractor of this Section 3.4 and shall indemnify, defend and hold Owner harmless against the consequences of any failure to comply with any Applicable Laws related to environmental protection.
Adequacy of Conditions:
(a) The Contractor represents that it has thoroughly investigated and satisfied itself as to: (i) the Works required hereunder; (ii) all environmental and climate risks, conditions, Applicable Law and restrictions (applicable to the Contractor or to the Works) that may affect the Works; (iii) the general character, quality, quantity and availability of equipment and materials required to execute and complete the Works; and (iv) all conditions affecting labor, including, without limitation, availability, productivity and administrative practices, including those relating to safety, prevailing at or applicable to the Works; (v) all conditions related to the economic and political situation of Chile; (vi) all conditions affecting importation of the Equipment or any asset or good into Chile, including the difficulties in connection with the Chilean ports and the customs and duties procedures.
(b) Any failure by the Contractor to discover matters which affect, or could affect, the Works shall not relieve the Contractor from its obligations under the Contract, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Contract, and cannot be claimed as a Force Majeure event.
Page 43 of 178
    
 Site and Site Conditions:
(a) The Contractor represents that it has visited and examined the Site and is thoroughly familiarized and satisfied with the Site and the conditions existing at and around the Site, including, but not limited to, boundaries, accessibility and access roads, the existence of the surrounding activities, surface and underground conditions, utilities, soil conditions, infrastructure, roads, unused underground utilities, climate and all other physical, topographical, geographical, and drainage conditions, including humidity, heat, dryness, wind charges, floods, and any other relevant characteristics of the Site (both current and historical) (the “Site Conditions”). The Contractor has found the same adequate and suitable for the execution and the performance of the Works and the fulfillment of the Contractor's obligations under this Contract, and waives any claim or argument relating to any incompatibility or inadequacy of the Site or its surroundings for the purposes of this Contract. In addition, Contractor represents that it is fully aware that during the performance of this Contract, there may be other significant projects under construction (either from entities related or not related to Owner) in the area or region of the Project. The Contractor has taken into account the difficulties that these projects’ concurrent execution may cause for construction and procurement purposes (including difficulties in hiring and/or accommodating personnel, acquiring, or renting construction equipment, among others).
(b) Subject to the foregoing and the Owner's responsibility for the Excluded Works, the Contractor acknowledges that neither the Site nor its conditions shall be reason for any increase in the Price or any extension in the Project Schedule or Change or derogate from the Contractor’s obligations hereunder, except for circumstances that may be deemed a Force Majeure event or Change Order Event.
(c) For the avoidance of doubt:
(1) Contractor shall be responsible, at its own cost, for performance of the Works, including all subsurface work and shall not be entitled to any Change Order as a result of surface or subsurface conditions encountered at the Project Site except as specifically set forth in this Contract
(2) Contractor shall be responsible for the civil infrastructure design for the Works. Contractor shall undertake, at its own cost, all relevant calculations and studies including geotechnical investigations, laboratory testing, geophysical studies, hydrology studies, topographical surveys, and other investigations, calculations and studies that are reasonably necessary to design and construct the Works. Therefore, any document or study delivered by Owner to Contractor in relation to the foregoing (including, for the avoidance of doubt those documents delivered prior to the Effective Date, or information that has been included in the Annexes) are only referential and have been provided to Contractor on a non-reliance basis. In no event shall the provision of the foregoing information by Owner to Contractor release the Contractor from its obligations as set forth in this Section, or its obligations as set forth elsewhere in this Contract. Under no circumstances shall Contractor be entitled to an increase in the Price or an extension of time on the basis of Contractor’s reliance upon information provided by Owner to Contractor as set forth above.

Contractor shall provide such information promptly after receiving such request, and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after receiving such request provided however, that if the Contractor, acting reasonably and having regard to the nature and scope of the requested information, believes that it requires more than the five (5) Business Day period set forth above to respond to Owner’s request, Contractor shall provide written notice to that effect prior to the expiry of such period. Such notice will set forth a request for the extension of such the period in which Contractor, together with a proposed deadline for providing such information. Owner shall consent to Contractor’s request, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree and acknowledge that Owner’s consent may be reasonably withheld if the provision of such consent would reasonably cause Owner to fail to be able to meet its obligations with respect to Applicable Laws, Applicable Permits or Environmental Guidelines, taking into account a reasonable time period for Owner to review such information.
Additional Reports.
For the purposes of this Section 3.7.4, the following shall constitute “Reporting
Events”:
(1) any circumstance, problem, emergency, strike, injury, work stoppage or legal problem be anticipated, or any unanticipated event occur which appears likely to (i) have a material adverse effect on the Contractor's ability to perform its obligations hereunder in a timely manner or has an adverse effect on the Works or the Project Schedule or the critical path of the Project; or (ii) constitute a potential or actual breach of the obligations under Legal Requirements; or (iii) adversely impact the ability to obtain or retain an Applicable Permit (including the RCA or any other);

For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with circumstances that may create a Change, the reporting obligations under Section 5.7 must also be complied with.
The waiver set forth in the preceding paragraph will apply in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Owner in accordance with this Contract arising from such breach by Contractor.
Notwithstanding any other remedy contained in this Contract, for all purposes under this Contract, if a report delivered by Contractor is not complete or in a format not substantially in the form set forth in Annex 9 [Forms of Report], such report shall be deemed not delivered to Owner and the liquidated damages under preceding paragraph (a) shall apply.

(1) upon becoming aware of any delay or anticipated delay in the Project Schedule (especially, but without limitation to, the Interim Milestones and the Critical Milestones) or upon becoming aware that it is likely to be any delay in progress which affects the critical path or become a cause of a change in the critical path (or any other relevant aspect observed in the Works, particularly if it could affect the critical path), Contractor shall immediately notify the Owner; or
(2) upon notification from Owner to Contractor, where a Monthly Construction Report shows that it is reasonably certain that a Critical Milestone will not occur on or before the relevant Guaranteed Date,
(b) After such initial notification by either (i) Contractor to Owner in accordance with Section 3.8.2(a)(1) above; or (ii) Owner to Contractor in accordance with Section 3.8.2(a)(2) above; Contractor shall promptly thereafter, but no later than ten (10) Business Days from the Progress Delay having taken place, and at no additional cost to the Owner, provide a recovery plan for the information of the Owner and perform whatever acts are required or requested by the Owner’s Representative to make up the lost time and to avoid any further delay in the performance of the Works (“Recovery Plan”). Upon receipt of the Recovery Plan, the Owner shall promptly, and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of such plan, submit to Contractor suggestions to such written recovery plan. If Contractor fails to receive any comments from Owner within such time period, Owner shall be deemed to not have made any comments on the proposed Recovery Plan. Contractor, shall, acting reasonably consider Owner’s suggestions, incorporate any suggestions it deems
Page 51 of 178
    
 reasonable and within five (5) Business Days after of the receipt of Owner’s suggestions, deliver the final version of the Recovery Plan to Owner. Contractor shall then diligently execute the Works in accordance with such Recovery Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, no Recovery Plan shall relieve Contractor from any of its obligations (particularly with respect to compliance with the Project Schedule), nor entitle Contractor to an increase in the Price, an extension of time, unless Contractor is otherwise entitled to a Change Order because a Change Order Event has occurred ( occurrence of a Change Order Event, in which case the provisions of Section 5.7.2 will apply). In particular, neither approval by Owner of such Recovery Plan nor Contractor’s prosecution of the Works in compliance with such recovery plan shall be deemed in any way to have relieved Contractor of its obligations under this Contract relating to the failure to timely achieve any Interim Milestone or Critical Milestone by the date required as set forth in this Contract. Any measures to make up for the delay shall be at the cost and expense of the Contractor.
Acceleration Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Contractor is complying with the Project Schedule, Owner may request Contractor to submit an acceleration plan to improve the completion of one or more Critical Milestone or Interim Milestone, or to cure a delay in the progress of the Works caused by an Delay Event caused by Owner or Force Majeure. Contractor shall submit such proposal indicating the costs involved in performing the same and its effects in improving the Project Schedule or curing the delays previously mentioned. Owner shall review such proposal and upon agreement with the terms thereof with Contractor, it shall issue a Change Order reflecting the agreed acceleration plan and its schedule and cost impacts. No implied or constructive acceleration claims are allowed hereunder, and any actual acceleration of the Works implemented by Contractor and not ordered by Owner by a formal Change Order shall be deemed to be at Contractor’s sole cost.
3.8.4 Extension of Time.
(a) Notices of Delay.
Contractor must immediately give written notice to the Owner (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Contractor becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware)) of any incident, circumstance and/or event of any nature affecting or likely to affect the progress of the Works such that the achievement of Interim Milestones or the Critical Milestones will be, is or are likely to be delayed (“Delay Event”). Such notice, must specify in reasonable detail, the following:
(1) the reason, nature and extent of any delay caused by the Delay Event;
(2) the corrective action already undertaken or to be undertaken in connection with the Delay Event;
(3) the effect of the Delay Event on the critical path noted on the Project Schedule (including the potential movement of activities or elements conforming the Project Schedule that were not originally on the critical path, onto the critical path);
Page 52 of 178
  
 (4) the period, if any, by which in its opinion any of the Guaranteed Dates should be extended; and
(5) a statement that it is a notice pursuant to this Section 3.8.4.
provided however, that if the Contractor, acting reasonably and having regard to the Delay Event, believes that it requires more than the five (5) Business Day period set forth above to address in reasonable detail the matters set forth by Sections 3.8.4(a)(1) to Sections 3.8.4(a)(5), Contractor shall provide written notice to that effect prior to the expiry of such period. Such notice will set forth a request for the extension of such the period in which Contractor may fulfil the requirements set forth by this Section 3.8.4(a), together with particulars of the Delay Event and as much of the information set forth by Sections 3.8.4(a)(1) to Sections 3.8.4(a)(5) as is reasonably possible to provide in such period. Owner shall consent to Contractor’s request for an extension of time, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Should Owner’s consent be granted, Contractor will use all reasonable efforts to provide the outstanding particulars as soon as possible, but in any event will provide the information set forth above within a fourteen (14) Day period from the date of Contractor’s request to extend the original five (5) Business Day period.
Notwithstanding any time limits set forth above, all documentation required to be delivered in accordance with this Section (including any Recovery Plan) must be submitted prior to the date on which Contractor must achieve, in accordance with the Project Schedule, the Milestone which Contractor purports will be affected by such Delay Event.
(b) Causes of Delay entitling to an extension of time.
The Contractor shall only be entitled to an extension of time for the completion of the Works where a delay to the achievement of a Critical Milestone is caused by a Change Order Event, provided that (a) it is a condition precedent to the Contractor’s entitlement to an extension of time that the critical path noted on the Project Schedule is affected in a manner which might reasonably be expected to result in a delay to the Contractor completing the Substantial Completion by the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Dates; and (b) none of the events comprising the definition of Change Order Event shall constitute a Change Order Event to the extent that performance of the Works were or would have been, at the occurrence of such event, suspended, delayed or interrupted by any other cause, including the act, omission, fault or negligence of Contractor, any Subcontractor, or any other person for whom Contractor may be liable.
(c) Request of an extension of time.
Should Contractor consider it is entitled to an extension of time, it must submit to Owner a Contractor’s Change Request in strict accordance with Section 5.7.2 and the relevant provisions thereto will apply to such request. In the event that the Contractor fails to submit any of the notices required under Section 5.7.2 within the times required, then, in relation to that delaying event the Contractor has no entitlement to any extension of time and the same effects provided for under Section 3.7.5 would apply.

Contractor shall: (i) perform such tests as are required by each Inspection and Review Elements, and (ii) provide Owner with an opportunity to inspect the Works that are relevant to each Inspection and Review Element. Should Owner reject the Works that are relevant to the applicable Inspection and Review Element, the Contractor shall immediately suspend all such portions of the Works that relate to the Inspection and Review Element (including Works of a similar nature occurring elsewhere at the Site) and rectify such Defect in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.6 and Section 9. Any suspension of the Works in accordance with this Section 3.11 will not entitle Contractor to any increase in price or extension of the Project Schedule. For Works or portions of the Works that are suspended in accordance with this Section 3.11, Contractor shall only be permitted to re-commence such Works after Owner has notified the Contractor in writing that it has remedied the Defect. Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 3.11.3 with respect to covered Works, providing Contractor has provided due notice of the occurrence of an Inspection and Review Element, should Owner not attend the inspection and testing conducted in connection with the Inspection and Review Element, then the applicable Inspection and Review Element shall be deemed reviewed (however under no circumstances shall such deemed review derogate from Contractor’s obligation to perform such Works in accordance with the Contract, including that such Works are free from Defects)

If any other portion of the Work has been covered which Owner, after having received the minimum advanced notice required under this Section, has not specifically requested to observe prior to being covered, Owner may request to see such Work and Contractor shall uncover it. If such other portion of the Work is found not to be in accordance with the requirements of this Contract, the cost of uncovering, replacement and re-covering shall be charged to Contractor. If such other portion of the Work is found to be in accordance with the requirements of this Contract, Owner shall pay such costs pursuant to an appropriate Change Order. Such inspection of any part of the Works (or lack of inspection) shall in no way relieve Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in accordance with this Contract.

Following the issuance of the Limited Notice to Proceed the Contractor shall commence the Early Works and shall proceed continuously and diligently to perform the Early Works.
(b) The Owner shall make the first Early Works Payment set out in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments] after the issuance of the Limited Notice to Proceed, against provision by Contractor of an advance payment guarantee in the amount and in accordance with the time periods set forth in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments] (the “LNTP Advance Payment Guarantee”), and thereafter and for the duration of the Early Works, shall pay the Contractor those monthly Early Works Payments in the amounts and on the dates set out in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments] (if applicable).
(c) The Parties acknowledge that the Early Works form part of the Works and shall be carried out in accordance with this Contract and that the Early Works Payments will be deemed to be part of the Price, and as such, if applicable, will be discounted from the corresponding Payment Milestone, to the extent the Early Work performed by Contractor under any given LNTP has been duly paid by Owner to Contractor, and that such Early Works overlap in part or in whole with the Works contemplated to be paid in any given Payment Milestone.

Early Works Schedule
(a) Contractor shall perform the Early Works within the Early Works Schedule. Failure of Contractor to timely deliver any Early Works in accordance with the timeframes set forth under the Early Works Schedule will make Contractor liable to pay the Owner Liquidated Damages set forth under Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments] (“LDs for Delays in Early Works”) (if applicable).
No issuance of LNTP; impact of issuance of LNTP on NTP Page 99 of 178
             
 It is hereby acknowledged that the Owner may elect, at its sole discretion, to issue the LNTP. The lack of issuance of LNTP will entitle Contractor to Change Order for an extension of time no greater than the time period set forth in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payment] for the performance of the Early Works, and shall not entitle the Contractor to an increase in the Price or any other form of compensation except as explicitly set forth in this Section 5.3.3. The exercise of Owner’s discretion with respect to the issuance of LNTP shall in no way affect Owner’s discretion with respect to issuance of NTP; for the avoidance of doubt, Owner shall be in no way obligated to issue NTP should Owner elect to issue LNTP.
Contractor’s obligations for the performance of Early Works
For the avoidance of doubt, all of Contractor’s obligations arising out of or in connection with Contractor’s performance of the Works shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to Contractor’s execution of any Early Works.
Termination during performance of Early Works
The Owner may terminate the employment of the Contractor under the Contract at any time during the Early Works.
If the termination of the Contract is not as a result of a Contractor breach then neither Party shall have any further liability to the other as a result of such termination, save that the Contractor will be entitled to payment for any portion of the Early Works performed up until the date of termination in the amounts and on the dates set out in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments]. Owner will not be obligated to pay the Contractor more than the cumulative amount shown in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments] by the date of termination. Any application submitted outside of the time periods permitted under such Annex shall not be considered.
Where the Contract is terminated prior to the issuance of the NTP due to a Contractor default, the Contractor shall be liable to Owner for losses, damages and expenses arising out of or in connection with such Contractor default, provided that Contractor‘s liability arising out of or in connection with its performance of the Early Works will be limited to the aggregate amount of the price payable for the Early Works as set forth in under Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments]. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt: (i) any limitation of Contractor’s liability as set forth in this Section 5.3.5 shall not apply to the liabilities arising as a result of, or in connection with the circumstances mentioned under Section 13.2 (for which the Contractor shall fully indemnify the Owner for any prejudice, loss, damage, expense, or cost); and (ii) should Owner elect to issue NTP, the Early Works performed prior to such NTP will be subject to the general liability regime under Section 13.

(c) If the Notice to Proceed has not been issued, or has been issued and is not effective by the NTP Longstop Date, for reasons other than a Contractor breach, negligence or willful misconduct, either Party shall be entitled to terminate the Contract and neither Party shall have any further liability to the other as a result of such termination, save with respect to any Early Works, including, for the avoidance of doubt, that Contractor will be entitled to those amounts due in relation to the Early Works that have already performed and delivered to Owner which have not already been paid by Owner and which are due considering the dates set out in Annex 5 [Early Works Base Scope and Payments]. Should either party elect to terminate the Contract in accordance with this Section 5.4.1(c), it shall deliver written notice to that effect to the other Party.

Changes
Change Order request by the Owner
(a) The Owner has the right to request, at any time during this Contract, any Change or other deviation from this Contract, by sending the Contractor a notice describing the nature and scope of the requested change. For the avoidance of doubt, such request may (but it is not limited to) contemplating: (i) a Change in all or a portion of the Works, and/or; (b) acceleration of the Works for any reason, including to recover from delays caused by delay attributable to either Party, or a Force Majeure Event. Such notice shall be communicated by sending a Change Request complying with the relevant format under Annex 2 [Form of Change Orders] (“Owner Change Order Request”), and without invalidating this Contract.
(b) Upon receipt of the Owner Change Order Request, Contractor must send to the Owner, within a period of no more than ten (10) Business Days, a written communication of the proposed Change including a plan for its execution, the implications on the Price and Project Schedule, if any, and any other changes that may be necessary as a result of the Changes requested by the Owner. The Contractor shall detail the grounds and the criteria utilized for the calculation of the implication, if any, on the Price and/or the Project Schedule (a “Change Quotation”). The Change Quotation shall be prepared with no additional charge to the Owner and shall include, as appropriate, initial or baseline cost information regarding the relevant portions of the Works affected by the requested Change, cost of the Equipment added or deleted by such change, and estimated quantities of the Equipment and labor added or deleted by such change, a method of adjustment or an amount of adjustment to the
Page 104 of 178
    
 Price, if any, calculated on the basis of direct cost plus seven percent (+7%), for the proposed Change, together with supporting documentation sufficient to enable the Owner to verify each of the cost elements (to be followed and verified by actual invoices) of the Contractor's Change Quotation. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the mark-up over the direct cost is not to exceed seven percent (7%) for each Subcontractor and Contractor (which shall be made without double counting nor shall be cumulative), and such mark-up is to be imposed solely upon the Works to be conducted or modified in accordance with the proposed Change. Unless otherwise agreed, the Change Quotation shall consider any delay arising out of the Change and the basis for the calculation shall not exceed, in any event, the unit price basis mentioned under Annex 2 [Form of Change Orders, Form of Change Request and [Unit Prices for Change Orders] or, if not therein, at rates not to exceed then-current market rates supported by at least three independent quotations. In the event that the Owner instruct Changes that conduct to a reduction in the Price, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply insofar as is necessary to effect such reduction in the Price. Without prejudice to the Owner's other rights and remedies under or pursuant to the Contract, where the issue of a Change is necessitated by some default or breach of the Contract by the Contractor or for which it is responsible, any additional cost or expense incurred by the Contractor in complying with such Change shall be borne by the Contractor and the Contractor shall reimburse the Owner for any additional costs and expenses incurred by the Owner as a result of the implementation of that Change Order. The requirements set forth in this Section shall also apply for Change Quotations prepared by Contractor in response to Contractor’s change requests made in accordance with Section 5.7.2.
(c) If the Owner has not responded to the Contractor’s Change Quotation within a period of ten (10) Business Days, the Contractor shall forward a second written communication to the Owner, requesting a reply within a new period of five (5) Business Days. If the Owner fails to reply within such period, the Change Quotation communicated by the Contractor to the Owner shall be deemed to have been rejected by the Owner and the Contractor will abandon the Change request and continue the Works in accordance with the Contract Documents as in effect prior to the Change request by the Owner.
(d) If an agreement is reached between the Parties with respect to Change Quotation, then the Parties shall sign a Change Order.
(e) If an agreement is not reached within twenty (20) Days from a Change Quotation, Owner may refer the issue to the DRB under Section 26.2, or alternatively, to instruct the Contractor to proceed with the requested Change in which case the Contractor shall proceed with implementation of the request change and the question of the implications of such change on the Price and/or Project Schedule shall be referred to the DRB under Section 26.2.
Change Order upon request by the Contractor
(a) The Contractor will be entitled to request a Change Order only upon the occurrence of a Change Order Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Contractor shall not make any variations or alterations to the Works without the Owner’s prior written consent
Page 105 of 178
     
 which may be withheld or granted in Owner’s absolute discretion. For clarification, Contractor shall not be entitled to request a Change Order based on circumstances that do not constitute a Change Order Event. Contractor assumes all risks in connection with events or circumstances (either preexisting or subsequent) that do not correspond to a Change Order Event, such as errors, defects, omissions, or discrepancies in the Existing Documents, unforeseen or unforeseeable circumstances that do not constitute by themselves Force Majeure, or any other circumstance that is not a Change Order Event.
If a Change Order Event occurs necessitating a Change, the Contractor shall notify the Owner and submit to the Owner a written proposal for a Change Order (using the template included as Annex 2 [Form of Change Orders]) together with a statement informing that it is a notice pursuant to this Section 5.7.2. and a Change Quotation prepared in accordance with Section 5.7.1(b) or, in the case of a Change Order Event arising as a consequence of a Force Majeure Event (a “Force Majeure Change Order Event”), a Schedule Relief in accordance with Section 20.2, (the “Contractor's Change Request”), within five (5) Business Days of the Contractor become aware of such circumstances, or, in the case of a Force Majeure Change Order Event, in the timeframes set forth in Section 20.2, provided however, that if the Contractor, acting reasonably and having regard to the nature and scope of the requested information, believes that it requires more than the five (5) Business Day period set forth above to prepare such documentation, Contractor shall provide written notice to that effect prior to the expiry of such period. Such notice will set forth in reasonable detail (i) particulars of the Change Order Event that Contractor believes necessitates a Change; and (ii) a request for the extension of such the period in which Contractor, together with a proposed deadline for providing such information. Owner shall consent to Contractor’s request, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Contractor's Change Request shall be prepared with no additional charge to the Owner and shall include the information specified in Section 5.7.1(b), together with supporting documentation sufficient to enable the Owner to verify each of the cost elements or scheduling assumptions of the Contractor's Change Request.
Contractor will only be entitled receive Change Orders as and for the events described in this Contract to the extent that it has used best efforts to avoid, reduce and mitigate any potential delays to the Project Schedule; and has used all reasonable efforts to avoid, reduce and mitigate increased potential direct costs or indirect costs resulting from such events and that there are no concurrent delays for which Contractor is liable.
(b) The Owner shall respond to the Contractor's Change Request within a period of ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the Contractor's Change Request, or in the case of a Force Majeure Change Order Event, in the timeframes and manner set forth in Section 20.2, together with the requisite documentation as set forth above. If the Contractor's Change Request is approved by the Owner, then the Parties shall sign a Change Order. If an agreement is not reached within twenty (20) Days from receipt of the Contractor's Change Request, or in the case of a Force Majeure Change Order Event, in the timeframes and manner set forth in Section 20.2, then unless agreed otherwise by the Parties, the matter shall be referred to the DRB under Section 26.2 hereof.
Page 106 of 178
         
 (c) The Contractor shall afford the Owner the opportunity for inspection of the circumstances for the Contractor's Change Request, in order to enable the Owner to verify the need for such Contractor's Change Request.
(d) If the Contractor fails to provide such Contractor's Change Request to the Owner within the specified time and form, then the Contractor shall have no claim for any additional costs or delays attributable to such circumstances.
If the Change Order Event is based on a Force Majeure event, then all the specific requirements under Section 20 shall also be complied with by Contractor in order to submit a valid Contractor’s Change Request.
(e) In case the Change Order Event is based on a Change of Law, and where such Change Order Event consists in Contractor having to incur in additional works not contemplated in the scope of the Works or in to incur in additional costs or in the need of an extension of time for the completion of the Works, then, in addition to the process contemplated in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 5.7.2 (and to the extent it is not contravening the Applicable Law), Owner shall have the right to, at its sole discretion, instruct Contractor not to perform any of the specific works or actions that may be required as a consequence of the occurrence of the Change of Law in question, in which case the Change Order Request shall be deemed resolved.
Effectiveness of a Change Order
A Change Order pursuant to Section 5.7.1 or Section 5.7.2 will only become effective upon the execution of the Change Order by the Owner. An effective Change Order and the Works set forth therein shall constitute an integral part of this Contract and the Works hereunder, as amended by the Change Order. The Contractor shall not vary or alter any of the Works, except in accordance with a Change Order from the Owner.
Consequences of a Change Order
(a) The Contractor agrees and acknowledges that the Owner's written approval, or rejection in accordance with Section 5.7.1 of any request of a Change will not relieve the Contractor from any of its liabilities, responsibilities, and obligations under this Contract (unless otherwise expressly agreed by Owner in the relevant Change Order).
(b) Without derogating from the above, the Contractor shall execute any Change Order in such manner that shall mitigate, minimize, and avoid any increased costs and/or delays in Project Schedule, to the extent reasonably possible. Upon its due execution by both Parties, Change Orders are understood to be binding upon the Parties as if they form an integral part of the Contract. Each Change Order shall constitute a final settlement of all items covered therein, including any compensation for impact on, or delay or acceleration in or disruption to, performing the Work.
(c) Notwithstanding the above, the Owner, in its sole discretion, may by written notice to the Contractor elect to include any or all of the 'predetermined' additional works set forth in Annex 20 [Predetermined Additional Works], (the “Predetermined Additional Works”) as part of the Works hereunder, in which case the Contractor shall be entitled
Page 107 of 178
       
    6
to the amount corresponding to the agreed consideration for such Pre-determined Additional Works set forth in Annex 20 [Predetermined Additional Works], and such notice shall be deemed an agreed Change Order for all intents and purposes. The payment of such agreed consideration shall be made in the dates set forth in Annex 20 [Predetermined Additional Works].

Should Owner have reasonable grounds to believe that the manufacturer’s or vendors might challenge or contest the warranties (for example because of a failure of Contractor to comply with its terms), then Owner may require, in addition, a certificate issued by such manufacturer’s or vendors within fifteen (15) Days from the Notice of Substantial Completion (as defined below), indicating that such warranties are still fully valid and enforceable;
(s) Contractor has assigned to Owner all manufacturer’s and vendor’s warranties for the equipment conforming the Facility together with a certificate issued by Contractor indicating that such warranties are fully valid and enforceable and that there is no ground for the issuer of such warranties to contest them.
(t) To the extent not already achieved in accordance with the foregoing, Contractor has successfully completed any additional tests identified under Annex 1 [Technical Specifications], Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program], Annex 18 [CEN Tests], and Annex 34 [Inspection and Test Plan], and any other contractual specifications required for the achievement of Substantial Completion.
Notice and Report of Substantial Completion.
At such time as (a) Contractor has provided Owner with a preliminary report of all test results, and (b) Contractor believes that it has achieved the requirements under Section 6.4.1, it shall deliver a notice thereof (the “Notice of Substantial Completion”) to Owner. The Notice of Substantial Completion shall:
      (a) (b)
confirm achievement of the requirements set forth in Section 6.4.1; and
contain a report in the form of Annex 23 [Report for Notice of Substantial Completion].
For the avoidance of doubt, the notice shall include sufficient evidence for Owner to be able to verify Contractor’s achievement of Substantial Completion. Such evidence must be presented in a manner that will reasonably permit Owner’s review of such evidence within the time frame set forth for Owner’s response in Section 6.4.3.

 Achievement of Substantial Completion.
Within ten (10) Business Days of Owner’s receipt of the Notice of Substantial Completion, Owner will either:
(a) deliver to Contractor a written certificate stating that the requirements under Section 6.4.1 have been met, in which case the date of Owner’s delivery of written certification its acceptance of the achievement of Substantial Completion shall be deemed the date Substantial Completion has been achieved; or
(b) notify Contractor in writing that the evidence attached to the Notice of Substantial Completion has not been presented in a manner (i) consistent with the requirements set forth in Section 6.4.1; or (ii) which reasonably permits Owner’s assessment of the achievement (or otherwise) of Substantial within the time frame required for Owner’s response as set forth in this Section 6.4.3. Owner’s notice shall provide, in reasonable detail, the reasons why such evidence has not been presented in a reasonable form. Contractor will promptly, and in any case no later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such notice (or such other period as the Parties agree in writing), re-submit the Notice of Substantial Completion. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of Section 6.4.3(a) and Section 6.4.3(c), the date of Owner’s receipt of the Notice of Substantial Completion from Contractor shall be deemed to be the date of Owner’s receipt of such notice in the form reasonably acceptable to Owner; or
(c) notify Contractor in writing that the requirements for achievement of Substantial Completion have not been met, stating in reasonable detail the reasons therefore, in which case Contractor will promptly (and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt of Owner’s notice, or such other period as agreed in writing between the Parties) (i) take such actions as necessary to achieve such requirements, and (ii) issue to Owner an additional Notice of Substantial Completion If Owner notifies Contractor that such requirements have not been achieved, and it is later determined that such requirements had in fact been achieved, then the date of Owner’s receipt of the relevant Notice of Substantial Completion from Contractor shall be deemed the date Substantial Completion has been achieved.
If Owner fails to respond to Contractor’s Notice of Substantial Completion within ten (10) Business Day period following Owner’s receipt of Notice of Substantial Completion, then Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order (subject to complying with the requirements set out in Section 5.7.2) for any additional cost and/or schedule impact of such failure).
Guarantee of achievement of Substantial Completion.
Contractor guarantees that the Substantial Completion of the Facility shall be achieved on or before the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any other remedies available to the Owner in accordance with this Contract, Applicable Law or otherwise, if Contractor fails to achieve Substantial Completion by the Substantial Completion Longstop Date then Owner may terminate this Contract by written notice to the Contractor.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing applies in respect of the general conditions to the achievement of Substantial Completion as set forth in the Contract Documents, with particular
Page 117 of 178
      
 reference to the matters that are defined in Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program].
Creation of Punch List.
(a) Contractor may apply for Mechanical Completion notwithstanding the existence of minor items that fulfil the following requirements, the assessment of fulfilment of such requirements as determined by the Owner, acting reasonably:
(1) the items are duly identified in a list to be prepared and delivered to Owner prior to the delivery of the Notice for Mechanical Completion, including the date for proposed completion of the same and the Contractor’s reasonable estimate for the cost to complete each such item of the Works;
(2) the items, being minor items and insignificant Works, the non-performance of which does not derogate, adversely affect or delay or inhibit or interfere in any way with the general requirements mentioned under Section 6.1, the performance of which is still pending, (which items may not include any item which may affect the safety, performance, availability or reliability of the commissioning and start-up of the Facility);
(3) in aggregate, the sum of the reasonable estimates to remedy all items does not exceed an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Price.
(4) the proposed time limit within which Contractor will complete such remaining Works (not to exceed one (1) month after the date of Mechanical Completion).
Upon its receipt of such proposed punch list, Owner will review and direct Contractor to make any appropriate or necessary revisions to the same, after which Owner and Contractor will meet and consult in good faith to agree upon the definitive punch list (including the agreed time limits within which Contractor will perform such remaining Works) (such punch list, the “Mechanical Completion Punch List”). Once the Punch List is agreed upon, Owner will issue the Mechanical Completion Certificate (provided the other requirements mentioned under Section 6.1 are met), which will be granted conditional upon the full and timely completion of the items included in the Punch List. If Contractor has not completed such Works within the approved time limits set forth in the Mechanical Completion Punch List, then Owner may have such items completed at Contractor’s expense and collect the warranties delivered by Owner, in addition to any other action that Owner has under the Contract in case of Contractor ́s breach.
(b) Contractor may apply for Interconnection notwithstanding that items from the Mechanical Completion Punch List remain unremedied or additional items have been identified that the Parties, acting reasonably, consider are appropriate to add to the punch list, subject to the fulfilment of the of the following requirements, the assessment of fulfilment of such requirements as determined by the Owner, acting reasonably:
(1) the items are duly identified in a list to be prepared and delivered to Owner prior to the delivery of the Notice for Interconnection, including the date for
Page 118 of 178
     
 proposed completion of the same and the Contractor’s reasonable estimate for the cost to complete each such item of Works;
(2) the items, being minor items and insignificant Works, the non-performance of which does not derogate, adversely affect, or delay or inhibit or interfere in any way with the general requirements mentioned under Section 6.2, the performance of which is still pending, (which items may not include any item which may affect the safety, performance, availability or reliability of the commissioning and start-up of the Facility);
(3) in aggregate, the sum of the reasonable estimates to remedy all items does not exceed an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Price; and
(4) the proposed time limit within which Contractor will complete such remaining Works (not to exceed one (1) month after the date of Interconnection).
Upon its receipt of such proposed revised punch list, Owner will review and direct Contractor to make any appropriate or necessary revisions to the same, after which Owner and Contractor will meet and consult in good faith to agree upon the definitive punch list (including the agreed time limits within which Contractor will perform such remaining Works) (such punch list, the “Interconnection Punch List”). If Contractor has not completed such Works within the approved time limits set forth in the Interconnection Punch List, then Owner may have such items completed at Contractor’s expense and collect the warranties delivered by Owner, in addition to any other action that Owner has under the Contract in case of Contractor ́s breach.
Transfer of Care and Control to Owner.
(a) Contractor will have care, custody and control and the risk of loss of the Works and the Facility (including all equipment and materials) until the point at which Substantial Completion is achieved pursuant to Section 6.4.3, at which point the risk of loss and care, custody and control of the Facility will pass to Owner in accordance with Section 12.2.
(b) Should the Owner decide that the Facility or part of the Facility can be used for commercial purposes without material damage to it before achieving Substantial Completion, then the Owner may, without prejudice of its other rights under this Contract and on giving the Contractor 7 (seven) Days’ notice in writing of its intention so to do, start using the Facility in a reasonable and proper manner. Contractor shall cooperate so as to allow Owner such commercial operation and the relevant terms of the O&M Contractor Interface Contract shall apply. In that case, care, and custody of the part of the Facility that is being used by Owner will pass to Owner on the date that it starts using such part for commercial purposes. For greater clarity, partial commercial operation might occur, for example, if part of the Facility is interconnected to the Grid. All incomes related to the operation of the Plant shall be for the benefit of Owner.

Upon any amount being drawn under the Performance Bank Guarantee, the Contractor shall immediately provide the Owner with an additional supplementary Performance Bank Guarantee for each amount drawn under the Performance Bank Guarantee or reinstate the Performance Bank Guarantee to the original amount thereof.
The delivery of the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee by Contractor to the Owner as mentioned below is a condition precedent to the expiry of the Performance Bank Guarantee and the return thereof to the Contractor. Contractor's failure to deliver to the Owner the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee shall authorize the Owner to keep the Performance Bank Guarantee, to draw on the Performance Bank Guarantee and keep the proceeds thereof as cash deposit in lieu of the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee or, if the cash proceeds were already drawn upon, to keep the cash proceeds, in lieu of the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee during the Warranty Period.
Warranty Period Bank Guarantee
As a condition for achieving Substantial Completion, the Contractor shall provide Owner with a warranty bank guarantee in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Price (the “Warranty Period Bank Guarantee”).
The Warranty Period Bank Guarantee shall be in force as of the date in which Substantial Completion is achieved and until the date Final Completion is achieved (the “WPBG Expiry Date”).
The Warranty Period Bank Guarantee shall serve as security for the compliance by Contractor with any and all of its obligations and warranties from Substantial Completion and until issuance of the Final Acceptance Certificate, including without limitation the remedy of Defects, the Performance Guarantees, the Availability Warranty and payment of Liquidated Damages due to the Owner. In case of any breach or default by Contractor, the Owner shall be entitled to draw, at any time and from time to time, on the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee wholly or partly, as it may deem fit, and collect thereunder any and all amounts payable to it as a result of such breach or default. Upon any amount being drawn under the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee, the Contractor shall immediately provide the Owner with an additional supplementary Warranty Period Bank Guarantee for each amount drawn under the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee or reinstate the Warranty Period Bank Guarantee to the original amount thereof.
Letter of Acknowledgement from Parent Company
On the or prior to the date of signing hereof, the Contractor shall provide the Owner with a letter of acknowledgement from its parent company in the form of Annex 25 [Letter of Acknowledgement and form of Contractor Credit Support] duly executed by the Parent Company (the “Letter of Acknowledgement”).
Page 129 of 178
        
 The Contractor must, acting reasonably and in good faith, endeavor to agree any amendments to the Letter of Acknowledgement from its Parent Company requested by the Financing Entities or by the Owner for the purposes of obtaining finance for the Facility.
9 Defect Warranties
Defect Warranty
Defect Warranty
The Contractor hereby warrants that from the beginning of performance of Works at the Site, if applicable, and throughout the Warranty Period (or Latent Defects Warranty Period, as applicable):
1. the PV Plant, its subsystems, the Works and Equipment and all components thereof will be free from Defects, for which purpose any Works, Equipment or component thereof, that is not in conformity with any warranty or with the terms of this Contract will be considered to be defective and therefore containing Defect,
2. all Works performed by Contractor and Subcontractors shall be in accordance with Good Industry Standards;
3. the Works will be new, of good quality and free from Defects and deficiencies, whether latent or patent, in design, workmanship and materials,
4. the Works will be in compliance with the Contract documents (i.e., the accompanying data set forth in the Technical Specifications shall be used as basis for design and construction of equipment or, if not described in the Technical Specifications of suitable grade for its intended use when installed, comply with Good Industry Standards);
5. the Contractor will not be in known violation of any Applicable Laws and Applicable Permits which are applicable to Contractor’s performance of the Works at the time of its performance of such Works; and
6. unless otherwise specifically set forth in Annex 26 [Warranties] for specific Works and Equipment which requirements shall be satisfied during the Warranty Period, all items used in the Works, which are normally covered by manufacturer or supplier guarantee or warranty, must be covered by full and valid manufacturer or supplier guarantees and warranties, as the case may be, and that the corresponding guarantees or warranties’ certificates will be freely assignable to the Owner and the Financing Entities (the foregoing warranties constituting the “Warranty”, and the breach of a Warranty constituting a “Warranty Breach”).
Page 130 of 178
      
 (b) From the beginning of performance of Works at the Site and throughout the entire Warranty Period (or the Latent Defects Warranty Period, as applicable) the Contractor shall at its own cost and expense correct and make good any Works that failed to meet the Warranty either by repair or replacement at the Contractor’s discretion. If a Defect is encountered prior to Substantial Completion, the correction of such Defect shall in no way derogate from Contractor’s obligations to perform the Works in accordance with the Project Schedule, and Contractor shall not be entitled to any extension of time nor an increase in the Price in order to complete the Works in accordance with the Project Schedule.
(c) During the Warranty Period (or the Latent Defects Warranty Period, as applicable), the Owner shall advance a claim of a Warranty Breach by written notice to the Contractor within reasonable time following the discovery thereof (the “Notice of Defect”).
(d) The Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the Notice of Defect promptly but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after date of the Notice of Defect. No later than twenty-five (25) Business Days following the date of the Notice of Defect, Contractor shall present to Owner its proposal to remedy such Defect, such plan including the time period that the Contractor reasonably estimates is necessary to remedy the Defect, in the understanding that the Defect shall be remedied as promptly as possible taking into account its nature and its effect on the operation of the PV Plant so as to minimize (i) the impact of the corrective Works on the Project Schedule prior to Substantial Completion; and (ii) disruption on operations and revenue loss to the Owner after achievement of Substantial Completion. For the avoidance of doubt, after the achievement of Substantial Completion, Owner shall have the right to operate and otherwise use the Facility until such time as Owner deems prudent to suspend such operation or use in order to accommodate Contractor’s corrective Works. Contractor shall perform such corrective Works as soon as Owner deems it prudent to remove the same from service to permit such Works to be conducted by Contractor.
(e) If the Contractor: (i) fails to provide the acknowledgement of receipt of the Notice of Defect within the time frame specified in (c) above; (ii) fails to provide the remedy plan within the time frame set forth in Section (c) above such remedy plan being in a form reasonably satisfactory to Owner and incorporating any changes that have been reasonably requested by Owner; or (ii) fails to complete any necessary works within the corresponding correction time in accordance with the remedy plan and in accordance with Good Industry Standards, then in addition to any other remedy and/or right under this Contract and/or Applicable Law, Owner will be entitled: to perform such works directly or through third parties at Contractor’s expense up to the amount of the documented costs incurred to eliminate such Defect, plus a seven percent (7%) handling charge, and, where applicable, shall have the right to enforce the Warranty Bank Guarantee.
(f) The Warranty during the Warranty Period (or the Latent Defects Warranty Period, as applicable) shall not exclude any costs or expenses associated with the remedying of a Defect or the replacement of any Defective component (i.e. costs and expenses other than the cost of the purchase price of the pertinent equipment itself), including without limitation, the shipping costs of the equipment, customs, any travel, lodging
Page 131 of 178

 costs or expenses of the vendor's personnel etc. and any such costs or expenses shall be borne, in their entirety, by the Contractor.
(g) Immediately prior to the lapse of the Warranty Period, the Contractor shall assign unto the Owner the manufacturer and supplier guarantees and warranties remaining in force following the Warranty Period and all rights thereunder. This obligation shall apply to mutatis mutandis to the Latent Defects Warranty Period.
(h) With respect to Equipment or materials having a Warranty Period and which is not covered by an original manufacturer / supplier guaranty and warranty or, the original manufacturer and supplier guaranty and warranty do not apply to for the entire Warranty Period - during the remaining Warranty Period, the Contractor shall, at its own cost and expense, replace the defective Equipment.
(i) On or prior to Mechanical Completion, the Contractor shall provide Owner with a copy of all original manufacturer and supplier guarantees and warranties. On or prior to Substantial Completion, the Contractor shall deliver evidence that is reasonably satisfactory to Owner that all actions have been undertaken to ensure that all original manufacturer and supplier guarantees and warranties so that Owner has acquired the right to enforce said supplier guarantees and warranties directly and without the need for further assignment of rights. However, the Contractor accepts that, at the request of the Owner, it will have the responsibility to diligently enforce, during the Warranty Period, the relevant Subcontractors, vendors, manufacturers and/or suppliers’ warranties, in accordance with the terms of a power of attorney to be granted by the Owner, in a manner required to fulfill the Contractor’s Warranty obligations hereunder.
(j) In the performance of its obligations under this Contract, Contractor shall undertake all actions reasonably required to maintain the guarantees and warranties from manufacturers or suppliers, and shall refrain, and procure that its Subcontractors and all other parties acting on its behalf refrain, from taking any action that may invalidate such guarantee or warranty. If Contractor becomes aware of any event or circumstance that may result or has resulted in a breach of the foregoing obligation, it will promptly, and in no event no later than five (5) Business Days after becoming aware of such breach, inform Owner in reasonable detail of such event. No later than twenty (20) Business Days after date of Contractor’s notice to Owner in accordance with the previous sentence, Contractor will additionally, at its own cost, procure written confirmation from the applicable manufacturer or supplier that the guarantee or warranty remains unaffected by such act or omission of Contractor (or party acting on Contractor’s behalf), a copy of which shall be promptly delivered to Owner. Should Contractor be unable to procure such confirmation, Contractor will, at its own cost, replace the affected equipment with substantially identical equipment that is under valid guarantee or warranty.
(k) Without derogating from the provisions of this Section 9, and notwithstanding the delivery of the original manufacturer and supplier guarantees and warranties under paragraph (i) above, the Contractor will remain responsible for enforcing the warranty of the Subcontractors, vendors, manufacturers and/or suppliers of all the components of the PV Plant, during the Warranty Period, unless Owner elects, in its sole discretion, that a party other than the Contractor shall be responsible for the foregoing.
Page 132 of 178

(o)
(p)
(q)
The delivery of the original manufacturer and supplier guarantees and warranties to the Owner at Substantial Completion shall not relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations, responsibilities or liabilities under this Contract including without limitation, the Contractor’s Warranty set forth above.
For the avoidance of doubt, the enforcement of Subcontractor vendors, manufacturers and/or suppliers’ warranties and/or the unenforceability or inapplicability of the same shall not relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations under this Contract, including without limitation from any of its obligations under this Section 9.
The Contractor’s warranty hereunder shall apply irrespective of the identity of the entity providing the operation or maintenance services, provided however that in the event that the Contractor is not the O&M Contractor, the Contractor’s warranty hereunder shall be subject to the performance of the maintenance and operation of the PV Plant in accordance with applicable manufacturer operations and maintenance manuals, providing always that such applicable manufacturer operations and maintenance manuals are reasonable.
The Owner shall afford the Contractor the opportunity to comment on its proposed system for developing and recording data pertaining to the performance of the PV Plant and allow Contractor the opportunity to review operating and maintenance records and data relating to the same. The Owner shall provide the Contractor reasonable access to the PV Plant for the purpose of observing the operation and maintenance thereof.
If Contractor is obligated to repair, replace, or renew any Equipment, item or portion of the Works in accordance with this Contract (including with respect to Defective Works corrected prior to the achievement of Substantial Completion), Contractor will undertake a technical analysis of the problem and correct the “root cause” unless Contractor can demonstrate to Owner’s reasonable satisfaction that there is no material risk of the reoccurrence of such problem.
No correction or cure of any Defect shall be considered complete until Owner has reviewed and accepted such remedial works in a reasonable period (providing that such acceptance shall not relieve Contractor of its liabilities under this Contract with respect to such Works). So long as Contractor has been notified of a breach of Warranty prior to the end of the Warranty Period, the obligation to remedy such Defect shall survive the expiry of this Agreement.
Any defective Works re-performed and any defective component of the Works that is reworked, repaired or replaced by Contractor or its Subcontractors in satisfaction of Contractor’s obligations in connection with the Warranty remedying any resultant damage or Defect (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Serial Failures or Latent Defects), will automatically be re-warranted by Contractor with the Warranty, and Contractor will have the same obligations in relation thereto as set forth in this section, for a period equal to the greater of:
1. Twenty-four (24) months from the date such re-performance, rework, repair or replacement is accepted by Owner as being completed or
Page 133 of 178
 
 (r)
2. the remaining Warranty Period which is originally applicable to such component of the Works.
Without derogating from Contractor’s general obligations set forth in this Section 9, any Equipment deemed defective that has been replaced, if situated on the Site, shall be removed by Contractor at Contractor’s sole cost and expense.
Serial Failure
A “Serial Failure” shall have occurred if, during the whole length of the Warranty Period, a Defect (including a Latent Defect) or breach of Warranty arises on the same part or component in at least:
(i) five percent (5%) of PV modules;
(ii) ten percent (10%) of inverters
(iii) seven point five percent (7.5%) of transformers;
(iv) for other parts or components, at least ten percent (10%) of the same part or component.
such percentages being “statistically significant”, with a level of confidence of at least ninety five percent (95%).
For the avoidance of doubt, the part or component must be from the same manufacturer and of the same model to be considered the same part or component for the purposes of this Section 9.1.2.
If:
(i) Contractor becomes aware of a possible Serial Failure, the Contractor shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Owner of the existence of a potential Serial Failure; or
(ii) Owner notifies Contractor that it has reasonable grounds to believe that a Serial Failure exists
then Contractor shall procure that a third-party conducts, at its cost, a root cause analysis with respect to such Serial Defect, the identity of such party to be agreed between the parties at the Kick-Off Meeting. Should such third party be unwilling or unable to undertake such analysis, then the Owner will nominate up to five (5) third parties to conduct such analysis, and Contractor will elect the third party to undertake the analysis from such list of nominees. As soon as is reasonably practical thereafter, but in no case more than thirty (30) days following the occurrence of the Defect giving rise to the root cause analysis, Contractor shall provide Owner with a detailed written report (including the analysis of the third-party root cause analysis) which shall include an explanation of the likely cause(s) of the Serial Defect and the remedial action that will be required to avoid further defects of a similar nature in the Work.
Contractor shall as soon as practicable, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after completion of the root cause analysis, prepare and deliver to Owner, for Owner’s review and approval, a remediation plan to address the identified Defect(s) in the Work or breach of Warranty.
Page 134 of 178
    
 If Contractor fails to cause to be performed the root-cause analysis and provide the written report to Owner within the time period contemplated in this Section 9.1.2, or if Owner and Contractor cannot agree as to the existence of a Serial Failure or the appropriate remedy within twenty (20) Days after of becoming aware of the possible Serial Failure, then Owner shall have the right to refer the matter for resolution by the DRB pursuant to Section 26.2. For the avoidance of doubt, the onus of proving that such malfunction does not constitute a Serial Failure, is that of the Contractor.
No later than ten (10) Business Days following:
1. Owner’s consent to the Serial Failure remediation plan, Contractor, at Contractor’s sole risk and cost, shall implement such remediation plan; or
2. determination of the remedy for the Serial Failure pursuant to Section 26.2,
Contractor shall commence to undertake such action (the earlier of (y) the date on which such action begins; and (z) the date that is ten (10) Business Days following agreement as to or determination of remedy, being the “Serial Failure Warranty Works Start Date”) as is required to give effect to the relevant remedy:
(i) to each piece of equipment or Works that has a similar defect or similarly fails to perform (or might potentially have such defect or failure), regardless of whether or not such equipment or Works has yet to exhibit the adverse consequences of such defect or other root cause;
(ii) so as to address the cause, and not just the effect, of such Serial Failure; and
(iii) so as to cause the equipment and the Works to comply with the original requirements under this Contract (together, the “Serial Failure Warranty Works”).
Upon the completion of any redesign Work, but prior to any retrofitting required by this Section 9.1.2 as part of the Serial Failure Warranty Works, Contractor shall request the written approval from the Owner for such retrofitting.
Without limiting any other remedy available to Owner pursuant to this Contract, in the event Contractor fails to commence the Serial Failure Warranty Works by the Serial Failure Warranty Work Start Date or to complete the Serial Warranty Works on a timely basis, Owner shall, after giving Contractor at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior notice of Owner’s intent to perform or have third parties perform the Serial Failure Warranty Works, have the right to perform the necessary Serial Failure Warranty Works, or have third parties perform the necessary Serial Failure Warranty Works, at Contractor’s cost. Contractor shall, within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving Owner’s request for payment for the costs of Owner in performing or causing to be performed such Serial Failure Warranty Works, reimburse Owner for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by Owner with respect to such Serial Failure Warranty Works, plus a seven percent (7%) handling charge.
Similarly, without limiting any other remedy available to Owner pursuant to this Contract, in the event Contractor contends the existence of Serial Failure, Owner
Page 135 of 178
       
 shall have the right to perform the necessary Serial Failure Warranty Works, or have third parties perform the necessary Serial Failure Warranty Works, which performance shall be at Contractor’s cost provided if it is eventually determined pursuant to Section 26.2 that in fact it was Serial Defect. Contractor shall, within twenty (20) Business Days from receiving Owner’s request for payment for the costs of Owner in performing or causing to be performed such Serial Failure Warranty Works, reimburse Owner for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by Owner with respect to such Serial Failure Warranty Works, plus a seven percent (7%) handling charge.
Use of Spare Parts
The Contractor guarantees the availability, during the entire Warranty Period, of spare parts for all Equipment used in the PV Plant. If the Contractor becomes aware that a manufacturer of the original components of the PV Plant intends to stop manufacturing the relevant spare parts, it shall notify the Owner in order to enable it to buy the quantity of spares it deems appropriate. In case that during the Warranty Period, the use of a Spare Part is necessary to remedy any Defect under this Contract and the replaced part is covered by a manufacturer or supplier warranty, the Contractor undertakes to replenish any such Spare Part, by enforcement of the relevant warranty in accordance with the terms of such warranty at its own cost. If the spare part is not covered by a manufacturer or supplier warranty due to an act or omission of the Contractor, then the Contractor will replace the same at its own expense.
The Owner, in its sole discretion, may – at its own cost and expense – acquire additional spare parts, consumable items, and associated tools necessary for keeping the PV Plant in good operating condition for its commercial operation. Subject to the Owner's prior written consent, or alternatively, at the Owner's instruction, the Contractor shall use the Owner's spare parts for the remedy of a Defect. Should the Contractor use said spare parts, the Contractor shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for promptly replenishing the spare parts used by it with brand new and identical spare parts, compliant with this Contract.
Latent Defects Warranty Period
A Latent Defects Warranty Period will apply to the Works. The Latent Defects Warranty Period will commence in relation to each part of the Works on the expiry of Warranty Period for that part of the Works; and expire on the date that is one day after the day that is thirty-six (36) months after the commencement of the Latent Defects Warranty Period.
Contractor will be responsible for remedying any Latent Defects with respect to all or part of the Works during the Latent Defects Warranty Period in accordance with the Section 9.1.1.
       Emergency Works
 Page 136 of 178

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, Contractor agrees and acknowledges that immediate corrective action will be required in case where Defects cause an emergency that endangers life or property or creates a situation where there is a risk of a material breach of an Applicable Law or Applicable Permit by allowing the Defect to continue to exist without immediate corrective action. Under such circumstances, the Owner shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to perform or cause to be performed by a third Party such Works without notifying Contractor. All costs arising out of or in connection the performance of such Works shall be for the account of the Contractor. For the avoidance of doubt, Owner’s undertaking of (or failure to undertake) such corrective Works shall in no way relieve Contractor of its liability with respect to its obligations in accordance with, arising out of or in connection with this Contract.
Owner’s rights
The Contractor must perform any rectification works and investigations and tests under Section 9.1, at times and in a manner, which cause as little inconvenience and disruption to the operation of the Facility and the people accessing or using the Site and surrounding areas, to the extent reasonably possible.
The Owner’s rights under Section 9.1 are in addition to, and do not reduce or exclude, other rights available to Owner under this Contract and at law.
10 Performance and Availability Warranty
Performance Guarantee
As a condition for achieving Substantial Completion, the Contractor must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Owner, that the Works meet the Performance Guarantees identified under Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program] (the “Performance Guarantees”).
The Performance Tests shall be carried out in the manner and timeframes set forth in Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program].
As further detailed in Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program], if Contractor fails to meet the Performance Guarantees the Contractor shall:
(1) undertake all actions and measures necessary to improve the performance ratio of the PV Plant to achieve the Performance Guarantees; and also
(2) pay to Owner the Performance Liquidated Damages,
all in accordance with Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test
Program].
Throughout the duration of the Warranty Period for Production, the PV Plant’s actual measured yield and the performance ratio will be monitored and recorded continuously by the O&M Contractor and reviewed by the Owner.
Page 137 of 178
                  
 The accrual or payment of the Performance Liquidated Damages shall not absolve the Contactor from any of its obligations under this Contract including but without limitation, its obligation to take all necessary measures to correct defects and implement the requisite means in order to procure that the PV Plant achieves the Performance Guarantees during the Warranty Period for Production, nor shall it derogate from any right or remedy available to the Owner in the event of termination of this Contract, including without limitation, the Owner's right to termination and/or compensation for damages set forth herein.
If the result of the formula for the calculation of the Performance Liquidated Damages exceeds the Maximum Performance Liquidated Damage (as defined below), these shall be deemed as sole remedy, but only when the plant has achieved a minimum threshold of performance corresponding to ninety percent (90%) of the Contractor’s Guaranteed Performance, as defined in Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program]. Otherwise, if this minimum yield threshold is not reached, the Contractor‘s liability with respect to Performance Liquidated Damages shall be unlimited, and the payment of such liquidated damages by Contractor shall not derogate from any other right or remedy available to the Owner or from any of the Contractor's obligations under this Contract. In addition to the foregoing, the failure of the Plant to reach the minimum performance threshold of ninety percent (90%) of the Contractor’s Guaranteed Performance shall be a Material Breach of the Contract and Owner shall have the, the Owner shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Contract pursuant to Section 15.1.
Availability Warranty
During the Warranty Period for Production, the Contractor guarantees an average annual PV Plant will meet the Guaranteed Availability as provided in Annex 3 [Performance Guarantees and Acceptance Test Program] (the “Guaranteed Availability”).
If the PV Plant fails to meet the Guaranteed Availability then Contractor's obligations under this Contract shall apply in connection with failure to meet such guarantee, including but without limitation, the obligation to correct defects and implement the requisite means in order to procure that the PV Plant achieves the Guaranteed Availability.
Cap on Performance Liquidated Damages
The aggregate of the Performance Liquidated Damages may accrue up to twenty percent (20%) of the Price (the “Maximum Performance Liquidated Damages”). These shall be deemed as sole remedy for Contractor’s failure to meet the Performance Guarantees, subject to the Plant having achieved a minimum performance threshold corresponding to ninety percent (90%) of the Contractor’s Guaranteed Performance. Otherwise, if this minimum yield threshold is not reached, the Contractor‘s liability with respect to Performance Liquidated Damages shall be unlimited, and the payment of such liquidated damages by Contractor shall not derogate from any other right or remedy available to the Owner or from any of the Contractor's obligations under this Contract.
Page 138 of 178
         
 11 Liquidated Damages and Fines for Delays; Payment of Fines and LDs
Interim Milestones and Critical Milestones Delays
If an Interim Milestone is not achieved by its due date as set forth in Annex 16 [Liquidated Damages and Fines], the Contractor shall pay the Owner the amount set forth in Annex 16 [Liquidated Damages and Fines] in connection with the failure to achieve such milestone (such amounts being an “Interim Milestone Fine”).
If Contractor fails to achieve: (i) Mechanical Completion by the Mechanical Completion Guaranteed Date; (ii) Interconnection by the Interconnection Guaranteed Date; or (iii) Substantial Completion by the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, the Contractor shall pay the Owner delay liquidated damages in the amount set forth in Annex 16 [Liquidated Damages and Fines] (such liquidated damages the “Critical Milestone Delay Liquidated Damages”)
In the event however that, notwithstanding the delay in achieving an Interim Milestone or a Critical Milestone, this Contract is not terminated by the Owner, and the Contractor achieves both Commercial Operation and Substantial Completion by the dates set forth in Annex 4 [Milestones], then at Substantial Completion the Owner shall reimburse the Contractor for amount of the Interim Milestone Fines and Critical Milestone Delay Liquidated Damages actually paid by the Contractor to the Owner on account of a delay in achieving an Interim Milestone or a Critical Milestone. For the avoidance of doubt, if either Commercial Operation and Substantial Completion is not achieved on or prior to the applicable due date therefore, the Contractor shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any of the Interim Milestone Fines or Critical Milestone Delay Liquidated Damages.
Default Fines
If the Contractor fails to comply with the obligations set forth in Annex 16 [Liquidated Damages and Fines] to which a Default Fine applies (including without limitation failing to submit any of the reports or documents required to be submitted to the Owner according to this Contract), the Contractor shall pay the Owner such Default Fine for each infringement the amount set forth in Annex 16 [Liquidated Damages and Fines].
Payment of Liquidated Damages and Fines
Any liquidated damages and/or fines payable by Contractor to Owner in accordance with this Contract shall be paid at the election of the Owner, by:
Page 139 of 178
                
 (1) discounting the amount of the liquidated damage and/or fine from any amounts owing by Owner to Contractor, from the nearest Payment Request; or
(2) calling on any security granted by Contractor to Owner in connection with the occurrence of such an event; or
(3) direct payment from Contractor.
The Contractor shall continue to pay the liquidated damages and/or fines until the earlier of the following occurs: (i) the corresponding milestone triggering such liability has been achieved or the default which has triggered payment of such amount has otherwise been rectified; (ii) the Contract is terminated; (iii) the accrued liquidated damages reaches the applicable cap as set forth in this Contract.
Cap on Delay Liquidated Damages; Cap on overall liquidated damages
The aggregate Delay Liquidated Damages may, subject to Section ¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia.(b) accrue up to twenty percent (20%) of the Price (the “Maximum DLD”),
The aggregate of Delay Liquidated Damages and Performance Liquidated Damages may accrue up to twenty percent (20%) of the Price, subject to the Plant having achieved a minimum performance threshold corresponding to ninety percent (90%) of the Contractor’s Guaranteed Performance. Otherwise, if this minimum yield threshold is not reached, the Contractor‘s liability with respect to Performance Liquidated Damages shall be unlimited, and the payment of such liquidated damages by Contractor shall not derogate from any other right or remedy available to the Owner or from any of the Contractor's obligations under this Contract.
If the total liquidated damages payable by the Contractor accrue to more than twenty percent (20%) of the Price, then without derogating from any other right or remedy available to the Owner under this Contract or Applicable Law or from the Contractor's obligations under this Contract, the Owner will be entitled to terminate this Contract in accordance with Section 15.1, in which case the Owner shall be entitled to any right or remedy available to the Owner in the event of termination of this Contract, including without limitation, the Owner's right to compensation for damages exceeding the liquidated damages set forth herein.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that payment of the Delay Liquidated Damages or Performance Liquidated Damages shall not constitute a grace period nor grant the Contractor an extension in the Project Schedule for fulfillment of the Contractor's obligations.
Furthermore, accrual or payment of the Delay Liquidated Damages or Performance Liquidated Damages will not relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations under this Contract, including its obligation to otherwise comply with the Project Schedule, nor shall any failure of Owner to demand or collect payment of any Delay Liquidated Damages and Performance Liquidated Damages constitute a waiver to (i) the collection of such payment by Contractor; or (ii) any other remedy available to the
Page 140 of 178
          
 Owner in connection with Contractor’s failure to comply with its applicable obligations under this Contract.
12 Ownership And Risk

(iii) if the Equipment or component is to be imported into Chile, the date on which the material is loaded on to the mode of transport to be used to convey the material to Chile.
All titles shall, upon transfer to the Owner, be free and clear of any liens, claims, charges, security interests, and encumbrances whatsoever or any other third-party rights or circumstance which may affect the transfer of title to the Owner, as applicable or restrict the Owner’s or Owner’s rights therein. No Works, Equipment, documentation, or any part thereof shall be subject to any security interest, pledge, lien or agreement by which an interest therein is retained by the Contractor or any third party, and neither of the Contractor or any Subcontractor shall have any right of lien over the Site, the PV Plant or any Works or Equipment relating thereto or over any of the documentation. At the Owner's request, a security interest may be established over any Works or Equipment in favor of the Owner or the Financing Entities.
Transfer of title shall not relieve Contractor from risk of loss or from any of its duties and responsibilities with respect to the PV Plant, the Equipment, the Works, or
Page 141 of 178
      
 Documentation, or waive any rights of the Owner to insist on full compliance by Contractor with the Contract.
Risk
Without prejudice to the above, the Owner and the Contractor expressly agree that risk of loss and the full responsibility for the Works, Equipment, facilities, materials and equipment covered by this Contract shall vest with the Contractor until Substantial Completion and that upon Substantial Completion risk of loss to the PV Plant shall transfer from the Contractor to the Owner, subject to the Contractor's warranty obligations, and performance of all other obligations of the Contractor to be performed following Substantial Completion. Without derogating from any other provisions of this Contract, Contractor shall be responsible for the repair, replace, restore, or reconstruct any portion of the Works or Equipment that is lost, damaged, or destroyed prior to Substantial Completion.

Schedule Relief
Schedule Relief Generally.
The occurrence of an event of Force Majeure Event that prevents Contractor from achieving any Interim Milestone or Critical Milestone will entitle the Contractor to an extension thereof to the extent affected by the event of Force Majeure, only in as much as Contractor is demonstrably delayed in the performance of such Interim Milestone or Critical Milestone, as applicable, solely as a result of such an event of Force Majeure (“Schedule Relief”). For the avoidance of doubt, a claim for Schedule Relief arising out of the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure will only be available to the extent that Contractor is otherwise ready, willing, and able to perform the Works in accordance with the Contract (with particular reference to the performance of the Works in accordance with the Project Schedule). Contractor shall not be entitled to Schedule Relief for Works to the extent that Contractor’s performance of such Works in accordance with this Contract (with particular reference to performance of the Works in accordance Project Schedule): (i) has otherwise been affected by suspension, delay or interruption caused by or arising out of any act, omission, fault or negligence of Contractor (or that of any other person for whom Contractor may be liable), or (ii) Contractor would otherwise be unable to perform the Works in accordance with this Contract because of or arising out of Contractor’s act, omission, fault or negligence (or that of any other person for whom Contractor may be liable).

In order to be eligible for Schedule Relief (and subject further to the requirements set forth in Section 3.8.4, Contractor must provide Owner a request for Schedule Relief (the “Initial Relief Request”) within ten (10) Days counted from the day the event giving place to the relief request started, containing all detail reasonably available to Contractor at the time such Initial Relief Request is provided to Owner, in light of the circumstances of the grounds for Schedule Relief. Contractor shall update such Initial Relief Request on a weekly basis through the date which is thirty (30) Days after Contractor’s delivery to Owner of the Initial Relief Request and adjust such Initial Relief Request in light of Contractor’s comments, at which time such Initial Relief Request, as updated, shall be deemed final (as updated, the “Relief Request”). Where such thirty (30) Day period has elapsed without agreement from the Parties as to the contents of the Initial Relief Request, only the latest iteration (or comments
Page 160 of 178
     
 thereof) of the Initial Relief Request made by Owner will be considered for the Relief Request. Subject to the provisions of this Section (b), the Initial Relief Request shall, at a minimum, describe::
(1) the event of Force Majeure giving rise to the Initial Relief Request and whether such event has ceased or is continuing;
(2) the Schedule Relief requested;
(3) the actions taken by Contractor prior or after the submission of the Initial Relief Request, as applicable, to overcome and/or minimize the effects of the Force Majeure Event;
(4) the basis for and detailed calculations of the length of such Schedule Relief requested; and
(5) the effects, if any, of the requested Schedule Relief on the Critical Milestones Schedule.
Owner Assessment of Schedule Relief.
(1) Owner shall assess the Relief Request based on the reports and any other information provided by Contractor with the Initial Relief Request, as updated pursuant to Section (b). For such purposes Owner shall have the right, at any time, to request from Contractor additional information or clarification in connection with Contractor’s Relief Request.
(2) In the event that Owner in good faith does not agree with Contractor’s determination of the need for or length of any Schedule Relief requested, Owner shall so notify Contractor within fifteen (15) Days after receipt of the final update to such Relief Request, providing to Contractor its proposal for the term of Schedule Relief, or an explanation for why Contractor is not entitled to any Schedule Relief. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions upon which such Schedule Relief, if any, shall be granted. If the Parties fail to reach agreement within ninety (90) Days, such dispute will be subject to arbitration pursuant to Article 26.
(3) In the event that Owner in good faith agrees in part and disagrees in part with Contractor’s determination of the need for or term of any Schedule Relief requested, Owner shall so notify Contractor within fifteen (15) Days after receipt of the final update to such Relief Request, granting to Contractor the portion of the Schedule Relief as agreed by Owner and an explanation for why Contractor is not entitled to part of the Schedule Relief requested. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions upon which such disputed Schedule Relief, if any, shall be granted. If the Parties fail to reach agreement within ninety (90) Days, such disputed Schedule Relief shall be subject to Article 26.
(4) If the Parties agree on Schedule Relief (or if Schedule Relief is adjudicated pursuant to Article 26), the Parties shall implement such Schedule Relief by revising in writing the date for achievement of the Critical Milestones to reflect the new agreed (or determined) dates.
Page 161 of 178
    
 A failure to perform the obligations set forth or arising out of the Contract will not be regarded as being caused by Force Majeure unless the affected Party has given Owner notice of the event of Force Majeure and the anticipated delay in accordance with Section (b), failing which the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived its right to apply for an extension.
In an event of Force Majeure, the affected Party shall (i) use its best endeavors to prevent, remove, avoid and mitigate the effects of any Force Majeure Event, including without limitation, accelerating the work schedule and ensure prompt resumption of normal performance of the Contract after the cessation of the event of Force Majeure; (ii) provide notices to the other Party describing the event of Force Majeure, its cause, the efforts being made to remove, avoid and mitigate its effects and further estimates of the duration of the event of Force Majeure; and (iii) resume full performance under this Contract as soon as practicable.
The Parties acknowledge that, the best endeavors referred under (i) of the preceding paragraph, include an obligation to repair, rebuild or reconstruct facilities that may have been damaged by an event of Force Majeure or its consequences, as well as rescheduling construction or operational sequences or plans;
For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that, in no circumstances the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure will entitle the affected Party: (i) to suspend the performance of its obligations not concerned by the Force Majeure Event; (ii) to an extension of the Interim Milestones or the Critical Milestones other than as directly affected by the Force Majeure Event.
No event of Force Majeure will entitle Contractor to an increase in the Price.

 26 Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
Governing Law
This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Chile.
Technical Disputes
In the event a dispute arises between the Parties regarding a technical matter rather than a question of legal interpretation (a “Technical Dispute”), then either Party may submit the Technical Dispute to a Dispute Review Board (“DRB”) in accordance with the Dispute Board Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce which are incorporated herein by reference in effect at the time of its initiation (hereinafter the “DR Rules” and the “ICC”, respectively).
The DRB shall be constituted by one member appointed by mutual agreement of the Parties or, absent agreement, pursuant to the DR Rules.
The DRB shall issue an opinion or recommendation as per the DR Rules (the “Decision”).
Once the DRB notifies the Parties of its Decision in respect of the Technical Dispute, each Party shall have 15 Business Days to reject such a Decision, in which case either of the Parties may refer the Technical Dispute to be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in accordance with Section 26.4. In the event that neither of the Parties raises an objection within the aforesaid period, the DRB Decision will become binding on the Parties as if it were an obligation set out under this Contract. If the DRB does not issue the Decision within the time limit provided in the DR Rules, or if the DRB is disbanded pursuant to the DR Rules prior to issuing the Decision, the dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in accordance with Section 26.4.
If any Party fails to comply with a Decision, when required to do so pursuant to the DR Rules, the other Party may refer the failure itself—without having to refer it to the DRB first— to arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in accordance with Section 26.4. A Party that has failed to comply with a Decision, when required to do so pursuant to the DR Rules, shall not raise any issue as to the merits of the Decision as a defense to its failure to comply without delay with the Decision.
Good faith resolution of disputes
In the case of disputes, controversies, differences or claims which are not Technical Disputes (“Non-Technical Dispute”), either Party may (but is in no way required to) to attempt to resolve such disputes by mutual agreement by triggering a formal good faith negotiation procedure before starting an arbitration. To this end, each of the Owner and Contractor shall designate in
Page 169 of 178
            
 writing to the other Party from time to time a representative who shall be authorized to resolve by an agreement between them any Non-Technical Dispute in connection with the Contract and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, to exercise the authority of such Party to reach such an agreement. Such representative shall be from the upper management of the corresponding Party. Either representative designated by the Parties in accordance with this paragraph may notify the other of a Non-Technical Dispute, and the Parties shall meet within five (5) Days of such notice in order to negotiate in good faith to try and resolve such dispute. If any Non-Technical Dispute is not resolved between the Parties pursuant to this paragraph within thirty (30) Days from the date on which one Party receives written notification from the other Party that a Non-Technical Dispute exists in connection with the Contract, then such dispute shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration in accordance with Section 26.4. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to conduct negotiations as set forth in this section in no way precludes any party’s right to initiate arbitration under Section 26.4.
Arbitration
All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Party may submit to arbitration: (i) any Non- Technical Dispute; and (ii) any Technical Dispute that has been submitted to the DRB in accordance with the terms of Section 26.2 (d) or, a Technical Dispute that has not been submitted to the DRB. The Parties are not required to submit any Technical Dispute to DRB prior to the commencement of an arbitration under this Section.
Each Party will appoint one of the arbitrators, and such appointed arbitrators will then appoint the presiding arbitrator (the “Presiding Arbitrator”). Arbitrators appointed under this arbitration clause shall be fluent in both English and Spanish.
The seat and place of arbitration shall be Santiago, Chile, unless Owner determines at its sole discretion that the seat and place of arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland. In either case, hearings shall take place in Santiago, Chile.
The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the conferences and hearings of an arbitration may be conducted by audioconference, videoconference, or other similar means of communication in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC.
The arbitration will be conducted in Spanish. Documents in English will not require translation.
Consolidation and joinder
Before a dispute is submitted to arbitration, if the ICC has already appointed an arbitrator to resolve any dispute or conflict between the Owner and a third party performing any work or activities in relation to the Project or that interface with the Project (such as the O&M Contractor, or the contractors in charge of the Excluded Works or the Related Activities), (the “Prior Related Arbitration”), then the Owner has the right to request that the Presiding Arbitrator appointed under Section 26.4(c) be the same individual acting, or that acted, as arbitrator under the Prior Related
Page 170 of 178
             
 Arbitration, in which case Contractor and the other two arbitrators appointed under Section 26.4(c) shall be bound by such nomination made by Owner. For the avoidance of doubt, in case Owner elects not to exercise this right, the third arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to Section 26.4(c).
Further, to the extent permitted by the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC in effect at the time of the initiation of the dispute, the Owner shall be entitled to request the consolidation of the two or more of the following disputes into a single arbitration procedure (“acumulación de autos”): (i) two or more disputes under this Contract, or (ii) a dispute under this Contract with dispute or conflict between the Owner and the O&M Contractor.
Rights and obligations not under dispute remain on foot
For the avoidance of doubt, this Contract and all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall remain in full force and effect pending (i) the Decision in a Technical Dispute; and (ii) the award in any arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with this Section 26 (which award, if appropriate, shall determine whether and when any termination of this Contract shall become effective). For the avoidance of doubt, Contractor shall continue to perform this Contract (including the performance of all Works) even if a Technical Dispute has been subjected to DRB, or any dispute has been subject to arbitration as set forth in Section 26.4.
Immunity
Each Party, as to itself and its assets, hereby irrevocably, unconditionally, knowingly and intentionally waives any right of immunity (sovereign or otherwise) and agrees not to claim, or assert any immunity with respect to the matters covered by this Contract in any arbitration, expert proceeding, or other action with respect to this Contract, whether arising by statute or otherwise, that it may have or may subsequently acquire, including rights under the doctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state, immunity from legal process (including service of process or notice, pre- judgment or pre-award attachment, attachment in aid of execution, or otherwise), immunity from jurisdiction or judgment of any court, arbitrator, expert or tribunal (including any objection or claim on the basis of inconvenient forum), and immunity from enforcement or execution of any award or judgment or any other remedy.

(2) consents in respect of the enforcement of any judgment against it in any such proceedings in any jurisdiction and to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process in connection with such proceedings (including the making, enforcement, or execution of any such judgment or any order arising out of any such judgment against or in respect of any property whatsoever irrespective of its use or intended use).
