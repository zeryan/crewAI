    "Creating a multiagent system with the specified capabilities involves several steps and considerations. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this:\n",
    "1. **Define the Agents**: In this case, you would have at least three types of agents: the construction company, the supplier agents, and a negotiation agent. The construction company agent would initiate the search for suppliers, the supplier agents would respond with their services and quotations, and the negotiation agent would facilitate the negotiation process between the construction company and the suppliers.\n",
    "2. **Identify Suppliers**: The construction company agent would use a search algorithm to identify potential suppliers based on the service required. This could involve querying a database of suppliers, using a web scraping tool to gather information from supplier websites, or using a combination of these methods.\n",
    "3. **Delivery and Location**: To ensure delivery on site or nearest to the construction location, the construction company agent could include this as a requirement in the supplier search query. The supplier agents could then respond with their delivery capabilities and the locations they serve.\n",
    "4. **Quotation and Negotiation**: Once the suppliers have been identified, the construction company agent would request quotations from each supplier. The negotiation agent would then facilitate the negotiation process between the construction company and the suppliers. This could involve using a negotiation algorithm to determine a fair price, or using a more complex algorithm that takes into account factors such as the suppliers' past performance and the construction company's budget.\n",
    "5. **Implementation**: The multiagent system would need to be implemented using a programming language such as Python, Java, or C#. The system could be deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, or it could be deployed on-premises.\n",
    "6. **Testing and Deployment**: Once the system has been implemented, it would need to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the requirements of the construction company. Once testing is complete, the system could be deployed and used in the construction industry.\n",
    "Overall, creating a multiagent system with the specified capabilities is a complex but achievable task. It involves several steps, including defining the agents, identifying suppliers, facilitating quotation and negotiation, and implementing and deploying the system."
