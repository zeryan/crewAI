    "# Construction Business Developer Multiagent CBD\n",
    "I need to create a MultiAgent System to help my customers to get more, more serious and more reliable quotations of supplies and services for {industry} construction\n",
    "## UserÂ´s Problem Statement\n",
    "To get quotations for construction project sucks.\n",
    "It is a time consuming activity with a very low success rate for both parties: those who buy and those who sell. The issue is that, in both parties, there are oportunists, bankrupted, unexperienced, fraudulent, unreliable suppliers and subcontractors, and is hard to distinguish the good from the bad at first sight. Prequalification processes should be performed with time before construction startup, to identify who is technical, financially and administratively prepared, and to avoid early contract termination or defective works, among other negative cases. In spite of the above, there is not always time, since updated engineering designs are usually delayed, leaving little time to prospect and find suppliers with competitive prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To create a multiagent system able to:\n",
    "- get construction information from Environmental Qualification Resolution and attached documentation contained in \"RCA\" folder located in url given by user.\n",
    "- estimate quantities of works and to generate technical specifications for subcontractors.\n",
    "- estimate quantity of required materials and to generate technical specifications for suppliers.\n",
    "- generate manpower requirement position descriptions.\n",
    "- send cold email to suppliers and subcontractors.\n",
    "- generate contract documentation,based on referential documents uploaded by user.\n",
    "- get quotations for materials, machinery and services required for construction.\n",
    "- prequalify suppliers and subcontractors.\n",

    "This markdown outlines a multi-agent system (MAS) for construction business development. Let's break down the key elements and how CrewAI can be used to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user faces challenges in obtaining reliable and timely quotations for construction projects.\n",
    "The current process is time-consuming and prone to unreliable suppliers and subcontractors.\n",
    "Prequalification is crucial but often lacks time due to delayed engineering designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAS aims to automate and streamline the quotation process.\n",
    "It will leverage AI to extract information, estimate quantities, generate specifications, and manage communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAS proposes a comprehensive set of agents, each specializing in a specific area of construction project management.\n",
    "This includes agents for project management, construction management, quantity estimation, contract management, planning, cost management, safety, environment, security, supply chain, human resources, subcontractor management, quality, procurement, permits, engineering, legal, finance, community relations, and various technical disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAS defines tasks for each agent, such as document finding, reading, embedding, summarizing, works listing, specification, quantification, documentation, supplier prospection, prequalification, presentation, quotation, negotiation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAS will need to define workflows that connect these agents and tasks.\n",
    "This will involve defining the sequence of actions, data flow, and decision points.\n",
    "\n",
    "How CrewAI Can Help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent Definition: CrewAI allows you to define agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories. You can use this to create the agents outlined in the markdown.\n",
    "- Task Definition: CrewAI provides a framework for defining tasks with descriptions, expected outputs, agents, input data, and output files.\n",
    "- Workflow Management: CrewAI supports both sequential and hierarchical processes, enabling you to define complex workflows that connect agents and tasks.\n",
    "- Tools Integration: CrewAI allows you to integrate various tools, including those for document processing, data analysis, and communication.\n",
    "- Memory and Planning: CrewAI provides mechanisms for agents to share information and plan their actions.\n",
    "- Agent Monitoring: CrewAI's AgentOps and LangTrace tools can be used to monitor the performance and behavior of your agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Agents: Create agents in CrewAI using the Agent class, specifying their roles, goals, and backstories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Tasks: Define tasks for each agent using the Task class, specifying their descriptions, expected outputs, agents, input data, and output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Workflows: Define workflows using CrewAI's process management features, connecting agents and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate Tools: Integrate tools for document processing, data analysis, and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test and Deploy: Test your MAS thoroughly and deploy it to a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
